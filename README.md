Eldrow (Wordle in reverse) is an interactive Wordle solver that attempts to achieve near to mathematically perfect performance without relying on precomputations.

When you run Eldrow, it will give you a word to use as your initial try. You then have to color the word's letters one by one according to the color pattern that you got in Wordle, by pressing `g` for green, `y` for yellow and `x` for gray, and `Enter` when you're done. Then, repeat the process until the answer is found.

TO-DO:
- Tidy up some code
- Make it expandable to any other languages (right now only English is supported)
